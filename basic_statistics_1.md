## Basic Statistics

* Cases
* Variables
* Constants

### Types of variables

##### Categorical

* Nominal (different) / gender, city, country..
* Ordinal (different, order) / standings

##### Quantitative
* Interval (different, order, similar intervals) age
* Ratio (different, order, similar intervals, significant zero) height

##### Types of quantitative variables:

* Discrete
* Continuous

##### Issues

In practice: 
* Many times: interval = ordinal 
* Ordinal = interval if there is a scale with at least 10 categories

### Data Matrix and Frecuency Tables

* Categorical variable: categories
* Quantitative variable: create ordinal categories
* You can go to quantitative into ordinal, not the other way around

### Graphics

#### Types of graphics

##### Categorical variables

* Pie: few cases
* Bar: lots of cases

###### Quantitative variable

* Dotplot (puntos)
* Histogram (intervals/ bars = underlying continuous scale)
 
### Types of histograms

* Bell shaped
* Skewed left/right
* Bimodal
